This lecture is intended to introduce Geometric Algebra (GA). My goal is to show that the complementarity of the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ system arises not from something physical, but rather the even subalgebra, hidden within the GA of spacetime. This should be sufficient to entice the reader to ask the question: 
\\ \\
"What is the connection between spin-1/2 systems and geometry?"
\\ \\
In approaching this goal, I shall dive deeper into concepts commonly overlooked in any quantum mechanics course. These include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the cross product, outer product, and their relationship to duality,
    \item the Levi-Cevita tensor (only to hint at more fundamental relationships),
    \item the inner product and its relationship to the metric tensor,
    \item the even subalgebra of spacetime and its relationship to Pauli matrices--there out called Pauli vectors,
    \item and finally, deriving the commutator relationships of the even subalgebra, giving a brief outlook on its relationship to spin-1/2 systems.
\end{enumerate}
